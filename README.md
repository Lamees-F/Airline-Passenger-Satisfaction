# Overview



Customer satisfaction plays a major role in affecting the business of a company therefore analysing and improving the factors that are closely related to customer satisfaction is important for the growth and reputation of a company. 


The objective of this project is to guide an airlines company to determine the important factors that influences the customer or passenger satisfaction using   machine learning.

# Data


The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle which contains the data sourced from a survey conducted by airlines on the satisfaction level of passengers/customers based on various factors. The dataset consists of 25 columns such as Age, Gender, Travel class, Arrival and Departure delays and also features that influences customer satisfaction level such as On-board service, Cleanliness, Seat comfort, Baggage handling etc. 
The dataset consists of a column or feature named ‘satisfaction’ which describes the overall satisfaction level of the customer. It has two values, ‘neutral or dissatisfied’ and ‘satisfied’. This satisfaction feature is considered as the label feature since it conveys the overall experience of the customer based on the ratings given for other features.The dataset consists of  129,880 records.

# ML Models




This ML project has been developed using a famous python library called, Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.



Six models are used in this project to check for maximum Accuracy . They are:



* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine 
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Naïve Bayes
* Logistic Regression



# Conclusion



the Random Forest algorithm performed the highest accuracy with 96.42% while the Gussain Naive Bayes performed the lowest accuracy with 86.36%. Therefore, we can conclude that Random Forest as the best model.
